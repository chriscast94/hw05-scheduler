# hw05-scheduler

## Description
I have created a simple 12-hour planner to help organize the day. It provides time blocks between 9 am - 9 pm that's color coded to signify the past, present, and the future. You can enter what you need for the day and click save to save your schedule throughout the day. When you reload the page, the inputted text should stay on the page.

## Update
The appearance and functionality of the planner has significantly improved. The color coding for the hours, saving into the local storage and getting items from the local storage operates as intended.  

## Installation
1. Open Github and GitBash
2. Click on link for Repository "hw05-scheduler"

5. Go to Git Bash
6. Change directory to the location you wish to place it to
7. Type git clone and paste what you copied from the Git Hub repository
8. Press Enter to create clone
