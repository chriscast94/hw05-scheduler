# hw05-scheduler

## Description
I have created a simple 12-hour planner to help organize the day. It provides time blocks between 8 am - 8 pm that's color coded to signify the past, present, and the future. You can enter what you need for the day and click save to save your schedule throughout the day. When you reload the page, the inputted text should stay on the page.
